Resourceful blocks is a game inspired by [linear logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_logic) (specifically, constructive linear logic). The goal is to construct the appropriate blocks and bring them to their target locations. Blocks can be constructed according to various rules, consuming the blocks used. For example, with a *resource* `A` and a *factory* `A â†’ B`, you can consume them to construct `B`. There are other types of resources as well, so have a look.

A demo is available [here](https://hayashi-stl.itch.io/resourceful-blocks). I don't know if I'll continue to work on this, though.
