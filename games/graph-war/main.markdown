Graph War is a silly multiplayer game where you control your rocket with parametric equations. In the first round, you collect as many balls as possible while avoiding mines or other players' rockets. In the final round, you destroy as many of your opponent's balls as possible while avoiding other players' rockets. The mine layout is different every time. Will you think of a clever set of parametric equations to squeeze past them? Or will you be surprised as a typo you made sends you careening in an unintended direction?
