title: Decrement
description: "Puzzle game where the goal is to decrement every counter to 0 (In progress)"
---
Decrement is a puzzle game that almost looks like a regular puzzle game, but pretty much any object can have a counter on it. Blocks, enemies, coins, etc. Each counter counts a specific action, determined by the object. For example, fixed blocks count the number of times they're stepped on. The goal of each level is to get these counters to 0. It starts simple, but these counters can get wacky, so beware.

There is currently a demo avaliable [at itch.io](https://hayashi-stl.itch.io/discrete-decrement). However, it has the infamous "glue" mechanic,
which I have decided to remove because it was complicating things too much.
