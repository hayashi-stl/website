I make puzzles, do actual complexity theory research for games (specifically lower bounds), and theoretically make actual videogames
(The process is *long*.). I also think computer graphics is interesting. I've played the piano and the violin before, and I've composed
some videogame music.

Some favorites:
* Hunt puzzle type: konundrums, logic puzzle spoofs
* Lower bound result: [Literally every single 3D Mario platformer is PSPACE-hard](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.01256.pdf) (as of 2023) (I'm biased)
* Puzzle videogame: Baba is You
* Non-puzzle videogame: Super Mario Galaxy 1/2, Super Mario Odyssey
* Musical instrument: Drums
* Fruit: Mango
* Programming language: Rust

Some least favorites:
* Hunt puzzle type: cryptics, pop culture
* Fruit: Green apple
* Programming language: Lua? Javascript? (I like expressive type systems)
