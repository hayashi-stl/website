hunt: An All-American Puzzle Hunt
title: Travelling Abroad
answer: DOCKS IN NUNAVUT
---
The puzzle was a runaround around a building, involving 8 sets of instructions.

In each of the first 7 sets, the sentences' first letters spelled a country code. The instructions required
us to record three colors, from which, using the flag of the country as a code, we get a 3-digit ternary number.
Since 27â‰ˆ26, we extract a letter from the set by converting the ternary into a letter. This gives `DOCKS TO`.

The last instruction involves going somewhere really far away and recording the province. This gives `NUNAVUT`.

So the answer is `DOCKS TO NUNAVUT`.

### Notes:

This was one of the fastest puzzles I wrote. Unfortunately, it had an ambiguity in it, and of course,
because of its nature, it can't be preserved.
