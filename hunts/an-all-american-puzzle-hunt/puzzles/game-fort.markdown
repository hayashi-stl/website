On your tour of the fortress, you visit the seven stars in order. Then you visit the red jewels from highest to lowest, breaking ties by increasing distance from the sky islands guarding the fort. You find that one of them has moved and visit its original location afterwards. Finally, you mysteriously teleport up. Looking diagonally over the fortress, you find it deserted. What happened?
