* If two properties are opposites, exactly one of them appears in the list.
* The one property referenced by the clue directly below this one appears last in the list.
* $$\forall x,y,z, x(yz) = (xy)z$$ does not appear earlier than 3rd.
* Commutative appears somewhere before the property alluded to by the output required from a cross product for it to be commutative.
* Each property referenced by the clue directly above this one appears somewhere after each property referenced in the clue directly below that actually appears in the list.
* Between the properties that contain the word "identity", each one that appears in the list appears somewhere before each other property that starts with "I" and appears in the list.
* Each property that implies $$\forall y, âˆƒx, xx = x$$ does not appear in the list, unless contradicted by a clue somewhere above this one.
